If I encounter persistent errors, I consult generative AI for explanations and solutions, supplemented by online resources like YouTube tutorials for practical insights. When standard solutions are inapplicable, I explore creative workarounds to meet project requirements.\n\nPROJECT EXAMPLE: In the WingWatch project, a serverless web application for aviation enthusiasts, I faced a 'no-cors' error when fetching live flight data due to the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) security policy. Initial testing revealed that API requests were blocked, which could have derailed the project. I used generative AI to understand the CORS issue and researched solutions, identifying three potential approaches: using a third-party proxy, modifying the server (not feasible for a serverless project), or using an alternative API. The third-party proxy initially worked but quickly hit usage limits, and the server modification was incompatible with the assignment's requirements. After thorough testing, I pivoted to using Leaflet, a free mapping library, as a workaround to replace the Google Maps API, which also resolved related performance issues. This solution was rigorously tested to ensure data accuracy and user interface functionality, ultimately enabling the project to meet its deadline and perform reliably.\n\nKEY LESSON: Thorough testing and creative debugging were critical to identifying and resolving the CORS issue, ensuring the project's success under tight constraints."

      "answer": "My internship at JR Academy, my first professional experience, taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, communication, and adaptability. The primary takeaways were to avoid taking conflicts personally and to recognize that all team members share the common goal of project success. Misunderstandings or differing perspectives are inevitable in collaborative settings, but proactive communication can align efforts effectively.\n\nPROJECT EXAMPLE: While working as a Business Analyst on a website builder feature, I initially misunderstood my supervisor's priorities, focusing heavily on project-related functionalities I thought were central. My supervisor expressed disappointment with this misalignment. Recognizing the issue, I promptly organized a meeting to clarify expectations and revise the project plan, identifying which non-essential features to deprioritize to meet the deadline. By focusing on delivering core functionalities, we successfully launched the feature on time. My supervisor commended my result-oriented approach and adaptability, despite the absence of some advanced features.\n\nIMPACT ON FUTURE PROJECTS: This experience shaped my approach to future projects by emphasizing the importance of early and frequent communication with stakeholders to align on goals and expectations. I now prioritize setting clear milestones and regularly checking in to ensure alignment, especially under tight deadlines. Additionally, I approach team dynamics with a collaborative mindset, viewing conflicts as opportunities to refine project focus rather than personal setbacks.\n\nSKILLS APPLIED: Agile project management, stakeholder communication, Jira, Miro."

      "answer": "During my time at JR Academy, we had a project where the client significantly changed their requirements midway through development. Initially, we were building a simple content management system, but the client suddenly wanted to incorporate e-commerce functionality as well. This meant a complete redesign of our database schema and significant changes to our front-end implementation.\n\nI first worked with the team to assess the impact of these changes and created a detailed analysis of what components would need modification. Rather than starting from scratch, I identified which parts of our existing codebase could be adapted or extended. I then restructured our sprint plans in Jira, reprioritizing tasks to accommodate the new requirements while maintaining as much of our original timeline as possible.\n\nTo ensure the team stayed aligned, I scheduled additional stand-ups specifically focused on the scope changes. This helped everyone understand the new direction and allowed us to identify potential challenges early. By breaking down the new requirements into manageable chunks and distributing them based on team members' strengths, we managed to deliver the project with only a two-week delay from the original timeline.\n\nThis experience taught me the importance of flexibility, clear communication, and smart resource allocation when dealing with changing project requirements."

I am even more interested in data, especially in data modeling. I am obsessed with experimenting with my models and seeing their performance improve (or sometimes not). In my most recent study on predicting whether tennis players are left-handed or right-handed, I was able to create a model with 98% accuracy using CGAN and random forest techniques.\n\nLooking forward, I believe web development will continue to evolve towards more interactive, real-time experiences with greater integration of AI capabilities. Progressive Web Apps will likely become more prevalent, blurring the line between web and native applications. In data analysis, I see the field moving toward more automated pipelines and democratized access to advanced analytics tools, allowing non-specialists to leverage data insights. The integration of these two fields—creating data-driven web applications with sophisticated analysis capabilities—represents an especially exciting frontier that I'm eager to explore."

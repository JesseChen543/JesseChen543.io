      "id": 11,
      "question": "What's your perspective on AI-assisted coding or 'vibe-coding'?",
      "answer": "I believe AI-assisted coding can significantly enhance productivity when used strategically. However, for larger projects, over-reliance can lead to debugging challenges or architectural confusion.\n\nMy approach is to use AI to generate an initial project roadmap, then manually create the structure to ensure each component is modular and maintainable.\n\nIn my experience, AI struggles with generating coherent code for projects exceeding 2,000 lines. For optimal results, I establish clear guidelines to ensure AI-generated code meets readability and maintainability standards.\n\nI've developed a workflow that incorporates code quality tools like SuperLint to ensure all AI-generated code follows industry standards. This automated verification process helps maintain consistency and best practices across the codebase, regardless of whether the code was written manually or with AI assistance.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of generative AI is to produce the most likely output that will be accepted by users, which limits its effectiveness for creative tasks. As a creative person who enjoys developing new ideas, I find this distinction important.\n\nFor example, I conceptualized the terminal-style chatbot for my portfolio as an innovative interface that aligns well with the tech industry aesthetic—an idea that required human creativity rather than algorithmic prediction."

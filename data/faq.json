      "question": "Do you have experience working independently or remotely? How do you manage your time and stay organized?",
      "answer": "I work as a remote Tutor with HD Education, where I have the flexibility to accept or decline tutor requests. Since most requests come during exam periods, I've developed strong time management skills by starting early with my own assignments and revision, creating dedicated blocks for tutoring sessions. This proactive approach has helped me balance my responsibilities while delivering quality assistance to students."

      "id": 10,
      "question": "What would you consider your greatest weakness?",
      "answer": "I previously struggled with video interviews due to anxiety caused by the lack of immediate feedback. To address this, I developed a practice technique where I invite friends to simulate interviews, providing the real-time facial cues and responses that help me communicate more naturally. This approach has significantly improved my interview performance, and I recently passed my first online interview using these strategies."

      "question": "What's your perspective on AI-assisted coding or 'vibe-coding'?",
      "answer": "I believe AI-assisted coding can significantly enhance productivity when used strategically. However, for larger projects, over-reliance can lead to debugging challenges or architectural confusion. My approach is to use AI to generate an initial project roadmap, then manually create the structure to ensure each component is modular and maintainable. In my experience, AI struggles with generating coherent code for projects exceeding 2,000 lines. For optimal results, I establish clear guidelines to ensure AI-generated code meets readability and maintainability standards. Additionally, the nature of generative AI is to produce the most likely output that will be accepted by users, which limits its effectiveness for creative tasks. As a creative person who enjoys developing new ideas, I find this distinction important. For example, I conceptualized the terminal-style chatbot for my portfolio as an innovative interface that aligns well with the tech industry aesthetic—an idea that required human creativity rather than algorithmic prediction."

These activities reflect my appreciation for both strategic thinking and teamwork in recreational settings."

      "id": 14,
      "question": "How do you handle challenging situations or setbacks in your projects?",
      "answer": "PHILOSOPHY: 'We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible' (Interstellar quote). MINDSET: Positive approach to challenges. PROJECT EXAMPLE: WingWatch group project. CRISIS: Several severe bugs during final testing, including Google Maps API limit reached before submission deadline. ACTION: Volunteered to create separate branch to resolve issues when team was discouraged. SOLUTION: Successfully migrated from Google Maps API to Leaflet (free alternative) and fixed all bugs one night before deadline. KEY LESSONS: 1) Never give up on seemingly impossible challenges. 2) Clean, well-documented, structured code is essential for effective debugging under pressure."
